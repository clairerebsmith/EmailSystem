* Work submitted to this submission point will be classed as your official submission. By submitting, you are certifying that this is your own work, and that the work of others is duly acknowledged and correctly referenced. You may be asked to upload your work elsewhere (e.g. Turnitin), but this will not be classed as your official submission.
* It is YOUR responsibility to ensure that your work is successfully submitted. Always check your email receipt and the submission point to confirm your work has uploaded successfully. If there is a problem with your submission you can make changes or resubmit your work up to the given deadline. The last attempt you submit will be the attempt that is marked.
* If you have a learning contract which states that you must submit work with a blue sticker on it, type the words from the blue sticker at the top of the front page of your work.
* You must ensure that your work is submitted using the file format(s) specified by the Module Leader. Files must not exceed 250MB in size.
* If you are submitting up to 24 hours after the deadline without an approved extension, you can notify us of any extenuating circumstances via the Request Extension to Submission Deadline process in My Student Record. You must do this within 24 hours of the deadline.
* Further guidance, including what to do if you are unable to submit, can be found on Assessment4Students.
